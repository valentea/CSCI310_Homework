Please put all input testing files in the "input" folder of the project.

The output file is generated in the bin.

Run the project from the bin dir.

If you put other input files in the project to check my unit testing, place them in the "test" folder and name it "testInput.txt" like the file that is already there.

Instead of putting each class in its own .jar file, the entire project is put into one .jar file under the "dist" dir by the name "Project1.3.jar". (This being build 1.3 by my standard)

Also, running "ant test" populates the "doc" dir with all the testing documentation. Running "ant doc" only creates the doc folder.
